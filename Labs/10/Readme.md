The lab is about implementing a code with RL for a tic-tac-toe game. The code is based on the Q-leaening method and consists of 3 parts, the template part written by the professor, and 2 parts for playing the game with different agent cases. In on of them both players are RL agents which can learn based on thier experiences, but in the other part one of the players is a RL agent but the other one plays randomly, in this case the agent learns better
